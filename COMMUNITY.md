## Welcome!

Before proceeding, please review the Fn [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Welcome to the Fn Project Community! As our community grows, there's a need for more public 
roadmap exposure, organization of issues, and cadence on meetings in the open. I'll start by 
posting what we think is the road to 1.0 and beyond, and we'll start getting meetings on the 
calendar in the next few weeks as well as organizing this page.

Stay tuned for more.
