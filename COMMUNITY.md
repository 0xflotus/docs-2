## Welcome!

Before proceeding, please review the Fn [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Welcome to the Fn Project Community! As our community grows, there's a need for more public 
roadmap exposure, organization of issues, and cadence on meetings in the open. Here's a general list
of workstreams that have been talked about, which will be proposed as roadmap items once we 
start our weekly community calls in a few weeks.

Stay tuned for more.
